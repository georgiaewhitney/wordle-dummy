---

During the Pre-Apprenticeship FAC26 course, we were given a mock take-home challenge to practice potential employer coding challenges.

## Instructions

Make a start on your own version of the Wordle word game. Do not attempt to complete the game, just make a start on it.

Before you start:


- Find [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) online.
- Break up every part of the game into a separate user story.
- On a new GitHub repo, create an issue for every user story.
- Decide which user story you are going to focus on for the take-home challenge.
- Attempt to complete the selected user story. Do not attempt to complete the whole game.

## User Stories 

My user stories:

- [ ] 1. User can access the game on a public domain 
- [ ] 2. The app responds to the user's device formatting
- [ ] 3. User can see a set of instructions that explain how the game works
- [ ] 4. The game chooses a 5 letter word at random for the user to guess
- [ ] 5. The user can attempt to guess the word in the amount of attempts there are empty grid rows
- [ ] 6. The user can make their guess via their own keyboard or an on-screen keyboard
- [ ] 7. The user submits their 5 letter word via the on-screen submit or 'Enter'
- [ ] 8. After submitting, the letters in their submission render a colour depending on how correct/incorrect the answer
- [ ] 9. When the user makes the correct submission, the word appears with a congratulatory panel
- [ ] 10. If the user completes all of their attempts without getting the answer, the answer is shown with a bad luck panel
- [ ] 11. If the user guesses correctly, a congratulatory panel appears

## My Focus

I have decided to focus on User Story #8: 
>After submitting, the letters in their submission render a colour depending on how correct/incorrect the answer

I will complete the app as much as possible in order to render this function. 

Like, Wordle, the colours work as follows:

<code><span style="background-color:green; color: white;">Correct letter in correct location</span></code>
<code><span style="background-color:yellow; color: black;">Correct letter in incorrect location</span></code>
<code><span style="background-color:darkgray; color: white;">Incorrect letter not in word</span></code>
